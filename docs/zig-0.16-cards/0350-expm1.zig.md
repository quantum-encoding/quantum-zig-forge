# Migration Analysis: `std/math/expm1.zig`

## 1) Concept

This file implements the mathematical function `expm1(x)` which calculates e^x - 1 (the exponential function minus 1). This is more accurate than computing `exp(x) - 1` directly when x is near 0, as it avoids catastrophic cancellation. The implementation is ported from musl libc and handles special cases like infinities, NaNs, and boundary conditions properly.

The key components are:
- A public generic `expm1(x: anytype)` function that dispatches to type-specific implementations
- Separate implementations for `f32` (`expm1_32`) and `f64` (`expm1_64`) 
- Comprehensive test suites for both floating-point types covering special values, sanity checks, and boundary conditions

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

**No public API migration changes detected.** This is a pure mathematical function with a stable interface:

- **No allocator requirements**: This is a computational function that doesn't allocate memory
- **No I/O interface changes**: No file or stream operations involved
- **No error handling changes**: Function returns pure mathematical results, no error sets
- **API structure unchanged**: Simple function signature `expm1(x: anytype) -> @TypeOf(x)` remains consistent

The implementation uses low-level floating-point operations and bit manipulation, but these are internal implementation details that don't affect the public API.

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const math = std.math;

test "basic expm1 usage" {
    // Near zero - more accurate than exp(x) - 1
    const x: f32 = 0.001;
    const result = math.expm1(x);
    
    // Special cases
    try std.testing.expect(math.expm1(math.inf(f32)) == math.inf(f32));
    try std.testing.expect(math.expm1(-math.inf(f32)) == -1.0);
    try std.testing.expect(math.isNan(math.expm1(math.nan(f32))));
}
```

## 4) Dependencies

The file imports and uses:
- `std.math` - For mathematical constants and utility functions (`isNan`, `isNegativeInf`, `inf`, `nan`, `ln2`, `raiseOverflow`)
- `std.mem` - For `doNotOptimizeAway` (compiler optimization barrier)
- `std.testing` - For test assertions (`expect`, `expectEqual`)

**Analysis Result**: This file contains a stable mathematical API with no migration requirements from Zig 0.11 to 0.16. The function signature and usage patterns remain unchanged.
