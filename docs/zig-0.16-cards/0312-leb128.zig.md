# Migration Card: `std.leb128`

## 1) Concept

This file provides LEB128 (Little Endian Base 128) encoding and decoding utilities for Zig's standard library. LEB128 is a variable-length integer encoding format commonly used in debugging information formats like DWARF and in WebAssembly binaries. The module focuses on "advanced" fixed-width LEB128 encoding, which sacrifices the typical space efficiency of LEB128 in exchange for predictable field sizes, making fields relocatable for later patching.

Key components include functions for writing unsigned (`writeUnsignedFixed`, `writeUnsignedExtended`) and signed (`writeSignedFixed`) integers in fixed-width LEB128 format. These functions operate directly on provided byte buffers without requiring memory allocation.

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

**No significant API signature changes detected** between Zig 0.11 and 0.16 patterns in this file. The public functions maintain consistent patterns:

- **No explicit allocator requirements**: All functions work with caller-provided buffers
- **No I/O interface changes**: Functions operate directly on byte slices/arrays
- **No error handling changes**: All functions return `void` (no errors)
- **API structure consistency**: Functions follow direct computation patterns without init/open patterns

The primary evolution appears to be in implementation details:
- Use of newer standard library utilities (`std.meta.Int`, `std.math.IntFittingRange`)
- More explicit type casting with `@truncate`, `@intCast`, `@bitCast`
- Consistent use of comptime parameters for type safety

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");

// Write a fixed-width unsigned LEB128 value
var buf: [4]u8 = undefined;
std.leb128.writeUnsignedFixed(4, &buf, 1000);

// Write a fixed-width signed LEB128 value  
var signed_buf: [4]u8 = undefined;
std.leb128.writeSignedFixed(4, &signed_buf, -1000);
```

## 4) Dependencies

- `std.meta` (for `Int` type construction)
- `std.math` (for `IntFittingRange` in type calculations)
- `std.testing` (test infrastructure only)

**Note**: This module has minimal external dependencies and focuses on pure computation without I/O or memory allocation.
