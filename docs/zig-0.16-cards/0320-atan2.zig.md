# Migration Analysis: `std/math/atan2.zig`

## 1) Concept

This file implements the mathematical `atan2` function for calculating the arc tangent of y/x in radians, supporting both 32-bit and 64-bit floating-point types. The implementation is ported from musl libc and handles numerous special cases as documented in the function comments, including various combinations of zero, infinity, NaN, and finite values.

The key components are:
- A public generic `atan2` function that dispatches to type-specific implementations
- Internal `atan2_32` and `atan2_64` functions implementing the actual algorithms
- Comprehensive test coverage for both normal and edge cases

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

**No migration changes detected.** This is a pure mathematical function with stable API:

- **No allocator requirements**: This is a stateless mathematical computation that doesn't require memory allocation
- **No I/O interface changes**: The function operates purely on input parameters without any I/O dependencies
- **No error handling changes**: The function doesn't return error types - it uses standard IEEE 754 behavior for special cases (NaN, infinity)
- **API structure unchanged**: The function signature `atan2(y: anytype, x: anytype)` remains consistent with mathematical conventions

The function uses compile-time type resolution with `@TypeOf(x, y)` and provides clear compile errors for unsupported types, which has been stable across Zig versions.

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const math = std.math;

pub fn main() void {
    const y: f32 = 0.2;
    const x: f32 = 0.21;
    const result = math.atan2(y, x);
    
    // result now contains the angle in radians between the point (x,y) and the positive x-axis
    std.debug.print("atan2({}, {}) = {}\n", .{y, x, result});
}
```

## 4) Dependencies

- `std.math` - For mathematical constants (pi), utility functions (isNan, inf, nan), and related trigonometric functions (atan, abs)
- `std.testing` - For test assertions and expectations (only in test blocks)

This file has minimal dependencies and represents a self-contained mathematical utility that doesn't interact with system resources, memory allocation, or I/O operations.
