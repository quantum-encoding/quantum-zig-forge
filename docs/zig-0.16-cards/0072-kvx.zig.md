## Migration Card: KVX Target CPU Features

### 1) Concept

This file defines CPU architecture features and models for the KVX processor family. It's an auto-generated file that enumerates the available instruction set architecture (ISA) versions (v3.1, v3.2, v4.1) and specific CPU models (coolidge_v1, coolidge_v2) for the KVX target. The file provides a structured way to query and manipulate CPU feature sets through helper functions and defines dependency relationships between different ISA versions.

Key components include the `Feature` enum defining available CPU features, the `cpu` struct containing specific CPU model definitions, and utility functions for working with feature sets. The dependencies between features are explicitly defined (e.g., v3.2 depends on v3.1, v4.1 depends on v3.2).

### 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

This file follows a consistent pattern with other CPU target files in the standard library. The public API consists of:

- **Feature Enum**: Simple enum definition (`v3_1`, `v3_2`, `v4_1`)
- **Feature Set Utilities**: Generic functions generated via `CpuFeature.FeatureSetFns`:
  - `featureSet`
  - `featureSetHas` 
  - `featureSetHasAny`
  - `featureSetHasAll`
- **CPU Models**: Static struct definitions (`coolidge_v1`, `coolidge_v2`)

No migration changes are evident in this file as it follows the same pattern used across all CPU architecture definitions. The API uses static data structures and compile-time utilities rather than runtime initialization patterns that would require allocators or complex dependency injection.

### 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const Target = std.Target;

// Check if a CPU model supports specific features
const cpu_model = Target.kvx.cpu.coolidge_v2;
const features = cpu_model.features;

// Test feature availability
const has_v3_2 = Target.kvx.featureSetHas(features, .v3_2);
const has_v4_1 = Target.kvx.featureSetHas(features, .v4_1);

// Create a custom feature set
const my_features = Target.kvx.featureSet(&[_]Target.kvx.Feature{
    .v3_1,
    .v3_2,
});
```

### 4) Dependencies

- `std` (primary import)
- `std.Target.Cpu.Feature` (feature set functionality)
- `std.Target.Cpu.Model` (CPU model definitions)
- `std.debug` (for compile-time assertions)

**Migration Impact**: Low - This is a stable, auto-generated CPU feature definition file with no breaking API changes between 0.11 and 0.16.
