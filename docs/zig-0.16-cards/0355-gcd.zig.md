# Migration Card: `std/math/gcd.zig`

## 1) Concept

This file implements a mathematical utility function for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two unsigned integers using an optimized version of Stein's binary GCD algorithm. The key component is the public `gcd` function that takes two unsigned integer parameters and returns their GCD. The implementation handles various integer types including comptime integers, automatically selecting appropriate types and using bit manipulation operations like `@ctz` (count trailing zeros) for efficient computation.

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

**No Migration Changes Required**

This is a pure mathematical utility function that follows consistent patterns between Zig 0.11 and 0.16:

- **No Allocator Requirements**: The function is allocation-free and operates entirely on stack values
- **No I/O Interfaces**: Pure computation with no file/network dependencies
- **Error Handling**: Uses compile-time type checking rather than runtime error handling
- **API Structure**: Simple functional interface that hasn't changed between versions

The function signature `pub fn gcd(a: anytype, b: anytype) @TypeOf(a, b)` uses Zig's generic type system consistently across versions. The compile-time type validation ensures only unsigned integers are accepted.

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");

test "gcd basic usage" {
    const result = std.math.gcd(8, 12);
    try std.testing.expectEqual(result, 4);
}
```

## 4) Dependencies

- `std` - Base standard library import
- `std.math` - Mathematical utilities (for `IntFittingRange`)
- `std.debug` - Debug assertions

**Note**: This is a leaf module with minimal dependencies, primarily relying on builtin functions like `@ctz`, `@TypeOf`, and `@typeInfo` for its implementation.

*No migration changes needed - this utility function maintains consistent behavior and API across Zig 0.11 and 0.16.*
