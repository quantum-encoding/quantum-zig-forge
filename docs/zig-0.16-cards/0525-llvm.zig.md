# Migration Analysis: `std/zig/llvm.zig`

## 1) Concept

This file serves as a module re-export facade for LLVM-related functionality within the Zig standard library. It acts as a central entry point that exposes three core LLVM components: `BitcodeReader` for reading LLVM bitcode, `bitcode_writer` for writing LLVM bitcode, and `Builder` which likely provides LLVM IR construction capabilities. The file doesn't contain any direct implementations but rather aggregates these submodules into a single public API surface.

The structure is minimal - it simply re-exports three submodules from the `llvm/` directory and includes a test block that references each module to ensure they're compiled during tests. This pattern is common in Zig for organizing related functionality while maintaining clean namespace separation.

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

**No public API changes detected in this facade file.** This module only performs re-exports and doesn't define any public functions, types, or interfaces directly. The migration impact would be contained within the individual submodules (`BitcodeReader`, `bitcode_writer`, and `Builder`) rather than this aggregation point.

The file structure follows a consistent pattern between versions - module re-exports with test coverage. Any breaking changes would manifest in the actual implementation files being re-exported, not in this facade.

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const llvm = std.zig.llvm;

// Usage of re-exported LLVM modules
test "LLVM module access" {
    _ = llvm.BitcodeReader;
    _ = llvm.bitcode_writer;
    _ = llvm.Builder;
}
```

## 4) Dependencies

This file has no explicit imports beyond the three LLVM submodules it re-exports:
- `llvm/BitcodeReader.zig`
- `llvm/bitcode_writer.zig` 
- `llvm/Builder.zig`

The dependency graph for LLVM functionality would be built from these submodules rather than this facade file.

---

**Note**: This analysis only covers the facade file. For actual migration guidance, examine the individual LLVM submodules (`BitcodeReader.zig`, `bitcode_writer.zig`, and `Builder.zig`) which contain the functional implementations and public APIs.
