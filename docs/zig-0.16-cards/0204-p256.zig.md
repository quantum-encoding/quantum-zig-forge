# Migration Analysis: P256 Test File

## 1) Concept
This is a test file for the P256 elliptic curve cryptography implementation in Zig's standard library. It contains comprehensive unit tests that verify the correctness of P256 curve operations including ECDH key exchange, point arithmetic (addition, doubling), coordinate transformations, SEC1 encoding/decoding, scalar operations, and edge case handling. The tests validate mathematical properties and ensure compliance with expected test vectors.

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff
**SKIP: This is a test file, not a public API file**

This file contains only test functions and does not expose any public APIs for developers to use directly. The patterns shown here are test-specific usage patterns of the actual P256 API, which would be defined in the main `p256.zig` file. The migration analysis should focus on the actual implementation file that defines the public interface.

## 3) The Golden Snippet
Since this is a test file, there is no public API to demonstrate. The usage patterns shown are test-specific and don't represent the actual public API that developers would use.

## 4) Dependencies
- `std.testing` - Used for test assertions and expectations
- `std.fmt` - Used for hexadecimal string parsing
- `../p256.zig` - The actual P256 implementation being tested

**Note**: This analysis should be performed on the main `/lib/std/crypto/pcurves/p256.zig` file instead, as that contains the actual public API that developers would use for P256 elliptic curve operations.
