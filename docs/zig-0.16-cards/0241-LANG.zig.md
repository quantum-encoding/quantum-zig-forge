# Migration Card: DWARF Language Constants

## 1) Concept

This file contains DWARF debugging information language constants used for identifying programming languages in debug information. It defines numeric constants that correspond to different programming language identifiers as specified in the DWARF debugging standard. These constants are used by debuggers and other tools to recognize the source language of compiled code for proper debugging and analysis.

The file serves as a comprehensive enumeration of programming languages supported by the DWARF standard, ranging from traditional languages like C89 and Pascal83 to modern languages like Zig, Rust, and Mojo. Each constant represents a unique language identifier that would be embedded in debug information by compilers.

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

**No Migration Changes Required**

This file contains only public constant declarations with integer values. There are:
- No function signatures to migrate
- No allocator requirements
- No I/O interface changes  
- No error handling changes
- No API structure changes

The constants are simple integer values that remain compatible between Zig 0.11 and 0.16. Usage patterns for these DWARF language identifiers are unchanged.

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const dwarf = std.dwarf;

pub fn main() void {
    const source_lang = dwarf.LANG.Zig;
    std.debug.print("Debug info indicates source language: {}\n", .{source_lang});
    
    // Check if we're dealing with C-family code
    if (source_lang == dwarf.LANG.C or source_lang == dwarf.LANG.C_plus_plus) {
        std.debug.print("C/C++ debugging enabled\n", .{});
    }
}
```

## 4) Dependencies

This file has no imports and is self-contained. It only exports constant values.

**Primary Dependencies:** None
**Used By:** Debug information processing modules, compiler tooling
