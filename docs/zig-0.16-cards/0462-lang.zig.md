# Migration Card: std.os.windows.lang.zig

## 1) Concept

This file contains Windows Language Identifier constants for use in Windows system programming. It defines numeric constants representing various language codes (LCIDs) that are used throughout the Windows API for localization and internationalization purposes. The file serves as a comprehensive reference for language identifiers, including common languages like English, Spanish, French, Chinese, and many regional/lesser-known languages.

Key components include constants for neutral/invariant languages, major world languages, regional variants (like Chinese Simplified vs Traditional), and specialized language codes used in specific Windows locales. Each constant is a hexadecimal value representing the Windows LCID for that particular language.

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

**No Migration Required**: This file contains only constant declarations with no function signatures, struct definitions, or API interfaces that would be affected by Zig 0.16 migration patterns. The constants are simple `pub const` declarations with hexadecimal values that remain compatible across Zig versions.

- No allocator requirements (only constants)
- No I/O interface changes (no functions)
- No error handling changes (no error types)
- No API structure changes (no init/open patterns)

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const win_lang = std.os.windows.lang;

// Example usage of Windows language constants
pub fn main() void {
    const user_lang = win_lang.ENGLISH;
    const system_lang = win_lang.CHINESE_SIMPLIFIED;
    
    // These constants can be used with Windows API calls
    // that require language identifiers (LCIDs)
    std.debug.print("English LCID: 0x{x}\n", .{user_lang});
    std.debug.print("Chinese Simplified LCID: 0x{x}\n", .{system_lang});
}
```

## 4) Dependencies

This file has minimal dependencies as it only contains constant definitions. Based on typical Windows system programming patterns, it would likely be used with:

- `std.os.windows` (parent module)
- Windows API bindings for functions that accept LCID parameters
- No specific allocator-dependent modules required

**Note**: This is a constants-only file with no functional APIs that require migration. The constants remain valid and compatible between Zig 0.11 and 0.16.
