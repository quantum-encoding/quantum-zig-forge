# Migration Card: `std/os/linux/s390x.zig`

## 1) Concept

This file provides low-level system call interfaces and type definitions specifically for Linux on s390x architecture. It contains inline assembly implementations of system call wrappers (`syscall0` through `syscall6`) that handle 0-6 argument system calls using the s390x "svc 0" instruction. The file also includes architecture-specific implementations of thread creation (`clone`) and signal handling functions (`restore`, `restore_rt`), plus type definitions matching the Linux kernel ABI for s390x (like `Stat`, `blksize_t`, `time_t`, etc.).

Key components include the system call family functions with register-based argument passing, naked assembly functions for low-level operations, and the `Stat` structure definition with timestamp accessor methods. This serves as the foundation for higher-level OS abstractions on s390x Linux systems.

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

**No significant public API migration changes detected.** This file contains architecture-specific low-level system call implementations that remain stable across Zig versions:

- **System call interface stability**: The `syscallN` functions maintain the same signature pattern (system call number + u64 arguments)
- **Assembly-level implementation**: Uses stable inline assembly syntax with register constraints
- **Type definitions**: Core types like `Stat`, `time_t`, `off_t` remain consistent with Linux ABI
- **No allocator changes**: These are raw system call wrappers without memory allocation
- **No I/O interface changes**: These are below the level of stdlib I/O abstractions

The main change is the use of `@intFromEnum(number)` instead of direct enum value usage, but this doesn't affect the public API signature.

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const s390x = std.os.linux.s390x;
const SYS = std.os.linux.SYS;

// Example: Get process ID using syscall0
const pid = s390x.syscall0(.getpid);

// Example: Write to stdout using syscall3
const data = "Hello, s390x!";
_ = s390x.syscall3(.write, 1, @intFromPtr(data.ptr), data.len);
```

## 4) Dependencies

- `std` - Primary standard library import
- `builtin` - Compiler builtin functions and target information  
- `std.os.linux.SYS` - System call number definitions

**Note**: This is an architecture-specific low-level implementation file. Most developers should use higher-level stdlib APIs rather than calling these functions directly.
