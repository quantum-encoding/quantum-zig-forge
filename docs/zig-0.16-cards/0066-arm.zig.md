# Migration Card: `std/Target/arm.zig`

## 1) Concept

This file is an auto-generated ARM CPU feature and model database for Zig's target system. It defines:
- A comprehensive `Feature` enum listing all ARM CPU features (from basic 32-bit support to advanced extensions like AES, NEON, MVE, etc.)
- CPU model definitions (like `cortex_a53`, `cortex_m4`, etc.) with their specific feature sets
- Feature dependency relationships and metadata (LLVM names, descriptions)

The file serves as the authoritative source for ARM target capabilities in the Zig compiler, enabling CPU-specific optimizations and code generation. It's primarily used by the compiler internals rather than directly by application developers.

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

**No public API migration changes detected.** This file contains:

- Enum definitions (`Feature`) with no breaking changes
- Auto-generated feature set helper functions (`featureSet`, `featureSetHas`, etc.) that follow the same pattern
- CPU model constant definitions with struct initialization syntax
- Pure data definitions without allocators, I/O interfaces, or error handling

The API structure remains consistent between versions as this is primarily a data definition file generated from LLVM's CPU feature database.

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const arm = std.Target.arm;

// Check if a CPU model supports specific features
const cpu = arm.cpu.cortex_a53;
const features = cpu.features;

if (arm.featureSetHas(features, .neon)) {
    // Use NEON optimizations
}

// Check feature dependencies programmatically
if (arm.featureSetHas(features, .aes)) {
    // AES feature automatically implies NEON due to dependencies
}
```

## 4) Dependencies

- `std.Target.Cpu.Feature`
- `std.Target.Cpu.Model`
- `std.Target.Cpu.FeatureSetFns` (for feature set operations)

**Note**: This is a data definition file with minimal runtime dependencies. It's primarily consumed by the Zig compiler's target system rather than application code directly.
