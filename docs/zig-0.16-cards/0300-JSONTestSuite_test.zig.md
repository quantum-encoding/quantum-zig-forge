SKIP: Internal implementation file - no public migration impact

**Analysis:**
The provided file `/home/founder/Downloads/zig-x86_64-linux-0.16.0-dev.1303+ee0a0f119/lib/std/json/JSONTestSuite_test.zig` is completely empty (0 bytes). This appears to be a placeholder or test infrastructure file rather than a library with public APIs. Since there are no public functions, types, or exports, this file has no migration impact for developers using the standard library.
