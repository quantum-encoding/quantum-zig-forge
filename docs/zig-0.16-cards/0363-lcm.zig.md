# Migration Analysis: `std/math/lcm.zig`

## 1) Concept

This file implements a mathematical utility function for calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers. It's a pure mathematical function that takes two numbers of any integer type and returns their LCM using the formula: `lcm(a, b) = |b| * (|a| / gcd(|a|, |b|))`. The function handles edge cases by returning 0 when either input is zero, following the behavior established in C++ and Python implementations.

The key components are:
- A single public `lcm` function that accepts generic integer types
- Mathematical operations using absolute values and GCD calculation
- Comprehensive test cases covering zero values, negatives, and large numbers

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

**No breaking API changes detected.** This function maintains the same signature and behavior across Zig versions because:

- **No allocator requirements**: Pure mathematical computation with no memory allocation
- **No I/O interfaces**: No file or network operations requiring dependency injection
- **No error handling**: Function cannot fail - uses deterministic integer arithmetic
- **Same API structure**: Simple function call pattern unchanged

The function signature remains:
```zig
pub fn lcm(a: anytype, b: anytype) @TypeOf(a, b)
```

This uses Zig's comptime generics which have been stable across versions. The implementation relies on `std.math.gcd` and builtin `@abs`, both of which maintain stable interfaces.

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");

// Calculate LCM of two numbers
const result1 = std.math.lcm(8, 12);        // result1 = 24
const result2 = std.math.lcm(-23, 15);      // result2 = 345
const result3 = std.math.lcm(0, 5);         // result3 = 0 (edge case)
```

## 4) Dependencies

- **`std`** - Root import for standard library access
- **`std.math.gcd`** - Core dependency for greatest common divisor calculation
- **`std.testing.expectEqual`** - Test framework (development only)

**Migration Impact: LOW** - No changes required for existing code using this function.
