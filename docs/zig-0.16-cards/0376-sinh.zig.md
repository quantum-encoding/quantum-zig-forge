# Migration Card: `std/math/sinh.zig`

## 1) Concept

This file implements the hyperbolic sine function (`sinh`) for floating-point types (`f32` and `f64`). It's a mathematical utility function ported from musl libc that calculates the hyperbolic sine of a given input value. The implementation handles special cases including zero, infinity, and NaN values according to IEEE 754 standards.

The key components include:
- A public generic `sinh` function that dispatches to type-specific implementations
- Separate `sinh32` and `sinh64` implementations optimized for 32-bit and 64-bit floats
- Comprehensive test coverage including special case handling and numerical accuracy

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

**No significant API migration changes detected.** This is a pure mathematical function with stable interface patterns:

- **No allocator requirements**: Pure computational function with no memory allocation
- **No I/O interface changes**: No file or stream operations
- **No error handling changes**: Function never fails - returns mathematical results or special values (NaN, Inf)
- **Stable API structure**: Simple function signature `sinh(x: anytype) @TypeOf(x)` remains consistent

The function signature follows Zig's generic math pattern that has been stable across versions - it takes any floating-point type and returns the same type.

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const math = std.math;

const result = math.sinh(1.5);
// result is approximately 2.129279 for f32/f64
```

## 4) Dependencies

- `std.math` - Core mathematical functions and constants
- `std.testing` - Testing utilities (test-only)
- `expo2.zig` - Exponential function implementation (internal dependency)

**Note**: This is a stable mathematical utility with no breaking API changes between Zig 0.11 and 0.16. The implementation is pure computational mathematics without allocators, I/O, or error handling complexities.
