# Migration Card: `std/os/linux/arm.zig`

## 1) Concept

This file provides ARM-specific Linux system call implementations and type definitions for Zig's standard library. It contains low-level inline assembly wrappers for Linux system calls on ARM architecture, including functions for making system calls with 0-6 arguments (`syscall0` through `syscall6`), special implementations for `clone`, `restore`, and `restore_rt` functions, and ARM-specific type definitions and constants.

Key components include:
- System call wrappers using ARM's `svc #0` instruction
- ARM-specific hardware capability flags (`HWCAP`)
- ARM Linux VDSO (Virtual Dynamic Shared Object) definitions
- ARM-specific type definitions (`blksize_t`, `nlink_t`, `time_t`, etc.)
- ARM Linux `Stat` structure with proper field alignment for the kernel ABI

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

This file contains architecture-specific low-level system call implementations that haven't undergone significant API changes between 0.11 and 0.16. The key differences are primarily syntactic:

- **Inline Assembly Syntax**: Uses Zig's newer inline assembly syntax with explicit input/output constraints and memory clobbers
- **Enum Conversion**: Uses `@intFromEnum()` instead of the older `@enumToInt()` pattern
- **Type Consistency**: Maintains consistent u32/i32 types for ARM system call arguments and returns

The public API remains stable because these are fundamental system call interfaces that match the Linux ARM ABI specification.

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const linux = std.os.linux;

// Example: Using syscall2 to call the 'open' system call
pub fn exampleOpen() u32 {
    const path_ptr: u32 = @intFromPtr("test.txt".ptr);
    const flags: u32 = 0o666; // Read/write permissions
    return linux.arm.syscall2(.open, path_ptr, flags);
}

// Example: Using the Stat structure
pub fn exampleStat() void {
    var stat: linux.arm.Stat = undefined;
    // stat would be populated by a stat system call
    const mtime = stat.mtime(); // Access modification time
    _ = mtime;
}
```

## 4) Dependencies

- `std` - Main standard library import
- `builtin` - Compiler builtin functions and target information
- `std.os.linux.SYS` - Linux system call number definitions

**Note**: This file has minimal dependencies as it implements low-level architecture-specific functionality. It primarily relies on system call number definitions from `std.os.linux.SYS` and basic type definitions from the standard library root.

*This file represents stable, architecture-specific system interfaces that maintain compatibility with the Linux ARM ABI. The migration impact is minimal as these are fundamental system call wrappers.*
