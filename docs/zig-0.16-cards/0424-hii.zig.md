# Migration Card: std/os/uefi/hii.zig

## 1) Concept
This file defines data structures and constants for UEFI Human Interface Infrastructure (HII) packages. HII is a UEFI framework for managing user interface resources like fonts, strings, forms, and images in UEFI environments. The file provides type definitions for various HII package types including package headers, font packages with narrow/wide glyphs, string packages, and package lists.

Key components include:
- `PackageHeader` with package type constants
- `PackageList` structure for package list management
- `SimplifiedFontPackage` with glyph access methods
- Glyph structures (`NarrowGlyph`, `WideGlyph`) with Unicode and attribute data
- `StringPackage` for localized string resources

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff
This file contains only data structure definitions with no public functions that would require migration changes. The analysis reveals:

- **No explicit allocator requirements**: Only struct definitions, no factory functions or initialization methods
- **No I/O interface changes**: Pure data structures without I/O operations
- **No error handling changes**: No function signatures to analyze
- **No API structure changes**: Static type definitions only

The file consists entirely of `extern struct`, `packed struct`, and constant definitions that maintain compatibility between Zig versions. The pointer casting in `getNarrowGlyphs` uses modern Zig syntax but this is an internal implementation detail.

## 3) The Golden Snippet
```zig
const std = @import("std");
const hii = std.os.uefi.hii;

// Accessing narrow glyphs from a font package
fn example_usage(font_pkg: *hii.SimplifiedFontPackage) void {
    const narrow_glyphs = font_pkg.getNarrowGlyphs();
    
    // Iterate through available glyphs
    for (narrow_glyphs) |glyph| {
        // Use glyph.unicode_weight and glyph.attributes
        _ = glyph;
    }
}

// Working with package headers
const my_header = hii.PackageHeader{
    .length = 100,
    .type = hii.PackageHeader.forms,
};
```

## 4) Dependencies
- `std.os.uefi` - Core UEFI types and GUID definitions
- Builtin functions: `@ptrCast`, `@alignCast`, `@sizeOf` for low-level memory operations

**Note**: This file contains only data structure definitions with no public API functions that require migration. Developers would use these types when working with UEFI HII data but wouldn't need to change usage patterns between Zig 0.11 and 0.16.
