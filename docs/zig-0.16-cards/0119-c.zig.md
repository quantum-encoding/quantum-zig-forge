# Migration Analysis for `lib/std/c.zig`

## 1) Concept

This file is Zig's cross-platform C standard library interface definition. It provides type definitions, constants, and function declarations that map to the underlying C library functions across different operating systems. The key components include:

- **Platform-specific type definitions** (ino_t, off_t, timespec, etc.) that vary by OS
- **System call constants** (O_RDONLY, S_IRWXU, AF_INET, etc.) with OS-specific values
- **Structure definitions** (stat, sockaddr, addrinfo, etc.) that match C library layouts
- **Function declarations** for POSIX and C standard library functions

The file uses extensive compile-time conditionals to provide the correct definitions for each target platform (Linux, Windows, macOS, BSD variants, etc.).

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

This file contains **no public Zig functions** - only type definitions, constants, and external C function declarations. Therefore:

- **No explicit allocator requirements** - all functions are external C declarations
- **No I/O interface changes** - the file defines interfaces but doesn't implement them
- **No error handling changes** - error handling follows C conventions
- **No API structure changes** - the file maintains C ABI compatibility

The file serves as a bridge to the underlying C library and doesn't contain Zig-level APIs that would be subject to the 0.11→0.16 migration patterns.

## 3) The Golden Snippet

Since this file contains only type definitions and external declarations, there are no Zig function implementations to demonstrate usage patterns. The file provides the foundation for C interop but doesn't expose Zig-level APIs.

## 4) Dependencies

Heavily imported modules that this file depends on:
- `std.builtin` - for target information
- `std.posix` - for POSIX constants and types
- `std.os.linux`, `std.os.windows`, etc. - for OS-specific definitions
- Platform-specific modules (darwin.zig, freebsd.zig, etc.)

**SKIP: Internal implementation file - no public migration impact**

This file provides C library bindings and type definitions but contains no public Zig APIs that would require migration from 0.11 to 0.16 patterns. It maintains C ABI compatibility across versions.
