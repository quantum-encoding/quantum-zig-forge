# MIPS Target Features Migration Card

## 1) Concept

This file is an auto-generated MIPS CPU feature and model definition module for Zig's target system. It defines the complete set of MIPS architecture features (ISA versions, extensions, and microarchitectural capabilities) that Zig's compiler can target. The file provides structured enums and feature sets that enable compile-time feature detection and CPU model configuration for MIPS processors.

Key components include:
- `Feature` enum defining all MIPS CPU features with their LLVM names and descriptions
- Feature set utility functions (`featureSet`, `featureSetHas`, etc.) for working with feature combinations
- Predefined CPU models (`cpu` struct) with their associated feature sets
- Dependency relationships between features (e.g., mips64r2 requires mips32r2 and mips64)

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

This file contains **no public function API changes** between Zig 0.11 and 0.16. The migration impact is minimal because:

- **No allocator requirements**: The API consists entirely of compile-time constants, enums, and feature sets - no dynamic allocation is involved
- **No I/O interfaces**: This is a pure data definition module with no file I/O or system calls
- **No error handling**: All operations are compile-time and cannot fail at runtime
- **API structure**: The feature set functions and CPU model definitions maintain the same structure

The primary usage patterns remain identical - developers query feature sets and select CPU models using the same enum-based approach.

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const mips = std.Target.mips;

// Check if a feature set contains specific MIPS capabilities
const features = mips.featureSet(&[_]mips.Feature{
    .mips32r2,
    .dsp,
    .dspr2,
});

// Verify feature presence
const has_dsp = mips.featureSetHas(features, .dsp);
const has_msa = mips.featureSetHas(features, .msa);

// Use predefined CPU model
const cpu_model = mips.cpu.mips32r2;
const model_features = cpu_model.features;
```

## 4) Dependencies

This module has minimal external dependencies:

- `std` (base standard library import)
- `std.Target.Cpu` (CPU feature and model definitions)
- `std.Target.Cpu.Feature` (feature set functionality)
- `std.Target.Cpu.Model` (CPU model definitions)

The dependency graph shows this is a leaf node in the target system hierarchy, primarily providing data definitions to higher-level target configuration modules.
