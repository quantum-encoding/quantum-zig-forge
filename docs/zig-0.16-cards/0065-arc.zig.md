# Migration Card: `std/Target/arc.zig`

## 1) Concept
This file is an auto-generated CPU feature definition for the ARC architecture target in Zig's standard library. It defines the available CPU features (currently just "norm" instruction support) and provides a generic CPU model definition. The file is part of Zig's cross-compilation infrastructure, specifically handling CPU feature detection and configuration for ARC processors.

Key components include:
- `Feature` enum defining available CPU features
- Feature set utility functions (featureSet, featureSetHas, etc.)
- `all_features` array containing detailed feature metadata
- `cpu` struct with CPU model definitions

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff
**No public API migration changes detected.** This file contains only data definitions and enum-based feature sets, which remain compatible between Zig 0.11 and 0.16. The public interface consists of:

- Enum definitions (`Feature`)
- Compile-time computed arrays (`all_features`)
- Feature set utility functions (generated via `CpuFeature.FeatureSetFns`)
- CPU model constants (`cpu.generic`)

No changes observed in:
- **Allocator patterns**: No allocator usage in public API
- **I/O interfaces**: No I/O operations
- **Error handling**: No error types or error handling
- **API structure**: No init/open patterns

## 3) The Golden Snippet
```zig
const std = @import("std");
const arc = std.Target.arc;

// Check if a feature set contains the 'norm' instruction support
const features = arc.featureSet(&.{.norm});
const has_norm = arc.featureSetHas(features, .norm);
std.debug.print("ARC norm feature available: {}\n", .{has_norm});

// Access the generic CPU model
const generic_cpu = arc.cpu.generic;
```

## 4) Dependencies
- `std` (root import)
- `std.Target.Cpu` (via `std.Target.Cpu.Feature` and `std.Target.Cpu.Model`)
- `std.debug` (for assertions in compile-time blocks)

**Note**: This is a target-specific feature definition file with minimal dependencies, primarily used internally by Zig's compilation system rather than directly by application developers.
