# Migration Card: std/os/windows/crypt32.zig

## 1) Concept

This file provides Zig bindings for the Windows Crypt32 API, which handles certificate and cryptographic operations. It defines types and functions for working with Windows certificate stores, including opening system certificate stores, enumerating certificates within those stores, and managing certificate contexts. The key components are Windows API function bindings for certificate store operations and the CERT_CONTEXT structure that represents individual certificates.

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

This file contains low-level Windows API bindings that follow consistent patterns across Zig versions:

- **No explicit allocator requirements**: These are direct C API bindings, not Zig-managed resources
- **No I/O interface changes**: Uses standard Windows handle-based API patterns
- **Error handling via return values**: Functions return nullable pointers or BOOL, consistent with C API conventions
- **API structure unchanged**: Functions like `CertOpenSystemStoreW` and `CertEnumCertificatesInStore` maintain their original Windows API signatures

The primary migration consideration is the use of `?*const anyopaque` instead of `?*c_void` or similar for the first parameter of `CertOpenSystemStoreW`, but this is a type system improvement rather than a breaking change.

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const crypt32 = std.os.windows.crypt32;

// Open the system root certificate store
const store = crypt32.CertOpenSystemStoreW(null, "ROOT");
defer _ = crypt32.CertCloseStore(store, 0);

// Enumerate certificates in the store
var cert_context: ?*crypt32.CERT_CONTEXT = null;
while (cert_context = crypt32.CertEnumCertificatesInStore(store, cert_context)) {
    // Process certificate...
    // cert_context.pbCertEncoded[0..cert_context.cbCertEncoded] contains the certificate data
}
```

## 4) Dependencies

- `std.os.windows` (for Windows-specific types and constants)
- No allocator dependencies (direct Windows API calls)
- No standard I/O modules required
