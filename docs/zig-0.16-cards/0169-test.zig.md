SKIP: Internal implementation file - no public migration impact

**Reasoning:** The provided file `lib/std/crypto/codecs/asn1/test.zig` appears to be a test file (as indicated by the "test" in the path name). Test files in Zig's standard library typically contain internal test cases and don't export public APIs that would require migration analysis. The empty content further confirms this is not a public API module that developers would interact with directly.
