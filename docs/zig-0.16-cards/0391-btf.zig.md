# Migration Card: BPF Type Format (BTF) Definitions

## 1) Concept

This file defines data structures and constants for working with BPF Type Format (BTF) in the Linux kernel. BTF provides type information for BPF programs and maps, enabling better debugging, verification, and introspection capabilities. The file contains:

- Header structure definition for BTF binary format
- Type system definitions including various type kinds (int, struct, union, enum, etc.)
- Supporting structures for type-specific data (arrays, function parameters, member offsets)
- Linkage and declaration tag information

This is essentially a low-level data definition file that provides the raw type definitions needed to parse and manipulate BTF metadata in BPF-related tooling.

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

**NO SIGNIFICANT FUNCTION SIGNATURE CHANGES DETECTED**

This file contains only type definitions, constants, and one test function. There are no public API functions that would be affected by Zig 0.16 migration patterns. The structures are all `extern struct` definitions with explicit field types and packed bitfields that maintain compatibility.

Key observations:
- No allocator-dependent functions present
- No I/O interfaces requiring dependency injection
- No error handling patterns to migrate
- All structures use explicit field types and packed layouts suitable for direct memory mapping

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const btf = @import("std").os.linux.bpf.btf;

test "BTF type creation example" {
    // Create a BTF header with proper magic and version
    var header = btf.Header{
        .magic = btf.magic,
        .version = btf.version,
        .flags = 0,
        .hdr_len = @sizeOf(btf.Header),
        .type_off = 0,
        .type_len = 0,
        .str_off = 0,
        .str_len = 0,
    };

    // Verify header fields match expected values
    try std.testing.expectEqual(btf.magic, header.magic);
    try std.testing.expectEqual(btf.version, header.version);
}
```

## 4) Dependencies

- `std` - Standard library imports
- `std.testing` - Used in the test block for assertions

This file has minimal dependencies and primarily serves as a self-contained definition file for BTF data structures.
```

**Analysis Summary:** This file contains only type definitions and constants for BPF Type Format structures. There are no public API functions that would require migration from Zig 0.11 to 0.16 patterns. The structures are all low-level memory layouts compatible with both versions.
