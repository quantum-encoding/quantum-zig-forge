# Migration Card: std.dwarf.EH.zig

## 1) Concept
This file defines data structures for DWARF Exception Handling (EH) encoding formats. It contains packed structs and enums that represent the Pointer Encoding (PE) format used in exception handling tables. The key components include the `PE` packed struct that combines encoding type, relocation type, and an undocumented GCC extension flag for indirect encoding.

The primary purpose is to provide type-safe representations of DWARF EH encoding specifications, including special handling for GCC extensions and proper bit-level layout control. This is used internally by the standard library's exception handling mechanisms and debugging facilities.

## 2) 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff
**No public function API changes detected.** This file contains only type definitions, constants, and enums - no functions. The migration impact is minimal as it defines data structures rather than behavioral APIs.

Key observations:
- Contains packed structs and enums with explicit bit layouts
- Uses `@bitCast` for the special `omit` encoding constant
- No allocators, I/O interfaces, or error handling in public API
- Pure data definitions remain stable across Zig versions

## 3) The Golden Snippet
```zig
const std = @import("std");
const dwarf = std.dwarf;

// Creating a PC-relative unsigned LEB128 encoding
const encoding = dwarf.EH.PE{
    .type = .uleb128,
    .rel = .pcrel,
    .indirect = false,
};

// Using the special omit encoding
const omit_encoding = dwarf.EH.PE.omit;

// Pattern matching on encoding type
switch (encoding.type) {
    .absptr => std.debug.print("absolute pointer\n", .{}),
    .uleb128 => std.debug.print("unsigned LEB128\n", .{}),
    .sleb128 => std.debug.print("signed LEB128\n", .{}),
    else => {},
}
```

## 4) Dependencies
**No external dependencies** - this is a self-contained data definition module. It only uses core language features:
- Builtin functions (`@bitCast`)
- Standard enum/struct definitions
- No imports from other stdlib modules

**Migration Impact: LOW** - Pure data structures with no behavioral changes.
