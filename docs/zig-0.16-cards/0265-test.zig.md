SKIP: Internal implementation file - no public migration impact

**Reasoning:**
- This is a test file (`test.zig`) which contains test cases for the std.fs module
- Test files typically don't export public APIs for external consumption
- The file appears to be empty (no content provided), further confirming it doesn't contain public interfaces
- Test files are internal implementation details of the standard library and don't represent APIs that developers would directly use
