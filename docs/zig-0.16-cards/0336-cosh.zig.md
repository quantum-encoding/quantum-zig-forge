# Migration Card: std/math/complex/cosh.zig

## 1) Concept
This file implements the hyperbolic cosine function for complex numbers (`ccosh`), ported from the musl C library. It provides mathematical operations for complex numbers by calculating the hyperbolic cosine of both 32-bit and 64-bit floating-point complex values. The implementation handles various edge cases including overflow conditions, infinity, and NaN values through bit-level manipulation and conditional branching based on floating-point representations.

Key components include a generic public `cosh` function that dispatches to type-specific implementations (`cosh32` for f32, `cosh64` for f64), with both implementations following the same mathematical pattern but optimized for their respective precision levels.

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

**No significant API migration changes detected.** This file contains mathematical utility functions that follow consistent patterns across Zig versions:

- **No allocator requirements**: Pure mathematical functions without memory allocation
- **No I/O interface changes**: No file or network operations
- **Error handling**: Uses standard floating-point operations without custom error types
- **API structure**: Consistent function signatures using Zig's complex number types

The complex number creation pattern `Complex(T).init(re, im)` appears stable and follows Zig's standard mathematical library conventions.

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const math = std.math;
const Complex = math.complex.Complex;

// Calculate hyperbolic cosine of complex number
const a = Complex(f32).init(5.0, 3.0);
const result = math.complex.cosh(a);

// result.re ≈ -73.467300, result.im ≈ 10.471557
```

## 4) Dependencies

- `std.math` - Core mathematical functions and constants
- `std.math.complex` - Complex number types and operations  
- `std.testing` - Testing utilities (test-only)

This is a mathematical utility file with minimal dependencies, focused purely on numerical computation without external I/O or memory management concerns.
