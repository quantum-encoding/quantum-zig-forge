# Migration Card: std/math/complex/acos.zig

## 1) Concept
This file implements complex number arc-cosine (acos) functionality in Zig's standard library. It provides a mathematical function that calculates the inverse cosine of a complex number, returning a complex result. The implementation uses the mathematical identity `acos(z) = π/2 - asin(z)` to compute the result by leveraging the existing complex arcsine implementation.

Key components include a public `acos` function that operates on complex numbers and a test case validating the implementation against expected values with floating-point precision tolerance.

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff
This file demonstrates minimal migration impact as it follows consistent mathematical function patterns:

- **No explicit allocator requirements**: Pure mathematical computation without memory allocation
- **No I/O interface changes**: Stateless mathematical operation
- **Error handling unchanged**: Function doesn't return errors; test uses standard assertion patterns
- **API structure consistent**: Uses `Complex(T).init()` constructor pattern which remains stable

The primary pattern visible is the use of `Complex(T).init()` for creating complex number instances, which follows Zig's standard struct initialization pattern.

## 3) The Golden Snippet
```zig
const std = @import("std");
const math = std.math;
const cmath = math.complex;

const a = cmath.Complex(f32).init(5, 3);
const result = cmath.acos(a);
// result.re ≈ 0.5469737, result.im ≈ -2.4529128
```

## 4) Dependencies
- `std.math` (mathematical constants and functions)
- `std.math.complex` (complex number types and operations)
- `std.testing` (test framework utilities)

The dependency graph shows this is a leaf node in the mathematical functions subtree, relying only on core mathematical primitives and testing utilities.
