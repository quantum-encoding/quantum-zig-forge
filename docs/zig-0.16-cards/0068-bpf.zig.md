# Migration Card: BPF Target Features

## 1) Concept

This file defines BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) target-specific CPU features and models for Zig's compiler infrastructure. It's an auto-generated file that provides metadata about BPF architecture capabilities including ALU32 instructions, debugging features, and version-specific CPU models. The key components are:

- **Feature Enum**: Defines available CPU features (alu32, dummy, dwarfris)
- **Feature Set Functions**: Utilities for working with CPU feature sets
- **CPU Models**: Pre-defined BPF CPU versions (v1 through v4, generic, probe)

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

This file contains **NO public API changes** between Zig 0.11 and 0.16 that affect developers. The file defines:

- **Enum types** for CPU features
- **Compile-time constants** for CPU models  
- **Feature set utility functions** that follow the same pattern as other target architectures

Key observations:
- No explicit allocator requirements (only compile-time data structures)
- No I/O interface changes (pure data definitions)
- No error handling changes (no runtime functions)
- No API structure changes (consistent with other target definitions)

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const bpf = std.Target.bpf;

// Check if a CPU model has specific features
const cpu = bpf.cpu.v3;
const features = cpu.features;
const has_alu32 = bpf.featureSetHas(features, .alu32);

// Use feature sets directly
const my_features = bpf.featureSet(&[_]bpf.Feature{
    .alu32,
    .dwarfris,
});
```

## 4) Dependencies

- `std.Target.Cpu` - Core CPU model and feature definitions
- `std.debug` - Compile-time assertions

**SKIP: Internal implementation file - no public migration impact**

*Note: This is an auto-generated target definition file used internally by the Zig compiler. Developers don't directly interact with these APIs in application code.*
