# Migration Card: `std/Target/msp430.zig`

## 1) Concept

This file defines MSP430 CPU features and models for Zig's target abstraction layer. It's an auto-generated file that provides architecture-specific configuration for the MSP430 microcontroller family. The key components include:

- An enum defining available CPU features (extensions, hardware multipliers)
- Feature set utility functions for querying CPU capabilities
- Predefined CPU models (generic, msp430, msp430x) with their respective feature sets

The file serves as a data definition layer that integrates with Zig's cross-compilation infrastructure, allowing the compiler to generate appropriate code for different MSP430 variants.

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

**No public API changes detected.** This file contains only data definitions and enum declarations without public functions that would require migration. The key observations:

- **No explicit allocator requirements**: The file contains no functions requiring memory allocation
- **No I/O interface changes**: No file I/O or stream operations present
- **No error handling changes**: Contains only compile-time data structures
- **No API structure changes**: All definitions are simple enums and struct initializations

The file uses modern Zig 0.16 patterns like `@intFromEnum` and `@typeInfo` but these are internal implementation details that don't affect public API usage.

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const msp430 = std.Target.msp430;

// Check if a feature set contains specific capabilities
const features = msp430.featureSet(&.{.ext, .hwmult16});
const has_ext = msp430.featureSetHas(features, .ext);
const has_any_hwmult = msp430.featureSetHasAny(features, &.{.hwmult16, .hwmult32, .hwmultf5});

// Use predefined CPU models
const cpu_model = msp430.cpu.msp430x;
```

## 4) Dependencies

- `std` - Base standard library import
- `std.Target.Cpu.Feature` - CPU feature abstraction
- `std.Target.Cpu.Model` - CPU model definition

**Migration Impact: LOW** - This is a stable data definition file with no breaking API changes between versions.
