# Migration Card: std/os/linux/mips64.zig

## 1) Concept

This file provides MIPS64 Linux-specific system call implementations and type definitions for the Zig standard library. It contains low-level inline assembly wrappers for Linux system calls (syscall0 through syscall6), a specialized pipe system call implementation, thread cloning functionality, and MIPS64-specific type definitions for system structures like `Stat`.

The key components are:
- Raw system call wrappers using MIPS64 assembly instructions
- Specialized implementations for `pipe` and `clone` system calls
- MIPS64-specific type definitions (blksize_t, nlink_t, time_t, etc.)
- VDSO (Virtual Dynamic Shared Object) constants for optimized system calls
- MIPS64-specific `Stat` structure with timestamp conversion methods

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

This file contains low-level system call implementations that are architecture-specific and haven't changed significantly in their public API patterns between Zig 0.11 and 0.16:

- **No explicit allocator requirements**: These are raw system call wrappers that don't allocate memory
- **No I/O interface changes**: These functions work directly with system call numbers and raw values
- **Error handling remains consistent**: Functions return raw u64 values where negative values typically indicate errors (following Linux convention)
- **API structure unchanged**: The syscallN pattern remains consistent across versions

Key observations:
- All syscall functions take `SYS` enum values for system call numbers using `@intFromEnum()`
- The `clone()` function uses `.naked` calling convention for low-level thread creation
- `Stat` structure provides convenience methods (`atime()`, `mtime()`, `ctime()`) that return `std.os.linux.timespec`

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const mips64 = std.os.linux.mips64;

// Example: Using syscall2 to call getpid (though typically you'd use higher-level APIs)
pub fn exampleSyscall() void {
    const result = mips64.syscall0(.getpid);
    // result contains raw system call return value
    // In practice, check for error by testing if result is in error range
}

// Example: Using the specialized pipe system call
pub fn examplePipe() !void {
    var fds: [2]i32 = undefined;
    const result = mips64.syscall_pipe(&fds);
    
    // Check for system call success (result == 0 means success on Linux)
    if (result != 0) {
        return error.PipeFailed;
    }
    // fds now contains [read_fd, write_fd]
}
```

## 4) Dependencies

This file has minimal dependencies, focusing primarily on:

- `builtin` - For target-specific configuration
- `std` - Through relative import (`../../std.zig`)
- `std.os.linux.SYS` - For system call number definitions

The dependency graph shows this is a leaf node in the standard library, providing architecture-specific implementations that higher-level OS abstractions depend on.
