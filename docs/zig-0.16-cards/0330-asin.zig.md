# Migration Card: std/math/complex/asin.zig

## 1) Concept

This file implements the complex arcsine function (`asin`) for complex numbers in Zig's standard library. It provides a mathematical function that computes the inverse sine of a complex number, returning another complex number as the result. The implementation uses complex number operations including multiplication, addition, square root, and logarithm to compute the arcsine according to the mathematical formula for complex numbers.

Key components include the main `asin` function that takes a complex number and returns its arcsine, along with a test case to verify the implementation's correctness. The function handles the complex arithmetic operations needed to compute the inverse sine in the complex domain.

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

**No significant API migration changes detected.** This file demonstrates stable mathematical utility patterns:

- **Struct Initialization**: Uses `Complex(T).init()` pattern which was already established in 0.11
- **No Allocator Requirements**: Pure mathematical computation without memory allocation
- **Static Error Handling**: No error returns - mathematical functions use floating-point results directly
- **Consistent Type System**: Generic complex type handling remains stable with `@TypeOf(z.re, z.im)`

The function signature `pub fn asin(z: anytype) Complex(@TypeOf(z.re, z.im))` follows established generic mathematical function patterns that were already present in 0.11.

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const math = std.math;
const cmath = math.complex;

const a = cmath.Complex(f32).init(5, 3);
const result = cmath.asin(a);

// result.re ≈ 1.0238227, result.im ≈ 2.4529128
```

## 4) Dependencies

- `std.math` - Core mathematical functions and constants
- `std.math.complex` - Complex number operations and types
- `std.testing` - Testing utilities (test-only dependency)

**Note**: This is a mathematical utility function with minimal dependencies and stable API patterns that don't require significant migration changes from 0.11 to 0.16.
