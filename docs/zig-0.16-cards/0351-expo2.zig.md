# Migration Analysis: `std/math/expo2.zig`

## 1) Concept

This file implements exponential base-2 functions (`expo2`) for floating-point types, specifically optimized for large input values where `x >= log(maxFloat(T))`. The implementation is ported from musl libc and provides specialized versions for both 32-bit and 64-bit floating-point numbers.

The key components include:
- A public generic `expo2` function that dispatches to type-specific implementations
- Internal implementations `expo2f` for `f32` and `expo2d` for `f64`
- Mathematical constants and bit manipulation operations optimized for each floating-point format

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

**No significant API changes detected.** This is a pure mathematical utility function with stable signature patterns:

- **Function Signature**: `pub fn expo2(x: anytype) @TypeOf(x)` - Uses Zig's generic type system consistently
- **No Allocator Requirements**: Pure mathematical computation, no memory allocation
- **No I/O Interfaces**: No file or stream operations
- **No Error Handling**: Direct computation without error returns
- **API Structure**: Simple function call pattern unchanged between versions

The implementation uses modern Zig features like `@bitCast` and `@exp` builtins, but these are internal implementation details that don't affect the public API.

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const math = std.math;

test "expo2 usage" {
    const large_value: f32 = 100.0;
    const result = math.expo2(large_value);
    // expo2 computes exp(x)/2 for x >= log(maxFloat(T))
}
```

## 4) Dependencies

- `std.math` (parent module import only)

**Note**: This file has minimal dependencies and only imports its parent math module for potential re-exports or organizational structure. It's a self-contained mathematical implementation that relies primarily on Zig builtins (`@bitCast`, `@exp`, `@TypeOf`) rather than extensive standard library modules.
