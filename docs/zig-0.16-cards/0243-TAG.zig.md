# Migration Card: DWARF TAG Constants

## 1) Concept
This file defines DWARF debugging information format tag constants used for debug symbol generation and parsing. It contains numeric constants representing various DWARF tags across different DWARF versions (DWARF 2 through 5) and vendor extensions (GNU, HP, MIPS, PGI, and Zig-specific extensions). These constants are used when working with debug information in compilation targets that support DWARF debugging formats.

The file serves as a comprehensive enumeration of DWARF tags, organized by DWARF standard versions and vendor extensions. Key components include standard DWARF tags for basic types, program structures, and debugging constructs, plus vendor-specific extensions and Zig's custom tags for compiler-specific debug information.

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff
This file contains only constant definitions (`pub const`) with no function signatures, struct definitions, or public APIs. All values are simple integer literals (hexadecimal constants). There are:

- No allocator requirements (no memory allocation patterns)
- No I/O interface changes (no file/stream operations)
- No error handling changes (no function calls)
- No API structure changes (no init/open patterns)

The migration from Zig 0.11 to 0.16 for this file is trivial - these constants remain unchanged and maintain identical usage patterns.

## 3) The Golden Snippet
```zig
const std = @import("std");
const dwarf = std.dwarf;

// Using DWARF tag constants for debug information handling
pub fn getTagName(tag: u16) []const u8 {
    return switch (tag) {
        dwarf.TAG.compile_unit => "compile_unit",
        dwarf.TAG.subprogram => "subprogram", 
        dwarf.TAG.variable => "variable",
        dwarf.TAG.GNU_call_site => "GNU_call_site",
        dwarf.TAG.ZIG_comptime_value => "ZIG_comptime_value",
        else => "unknown",
    };
}
```

## 4) Dependencies
This file has no imports and is self-contained. It defines constants only and would typically be used by:

- `std.debug` (for debug information handling)
- `std.dwarf` (other DWARF-related modules)
- Compiler backend code generating DWARF information
- Debug symbol parsers and debuggers

No external dependencies - this is a leaf node in the dependency graph.
