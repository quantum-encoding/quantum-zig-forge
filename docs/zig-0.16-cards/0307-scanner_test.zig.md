SKIP: Internal implementation file - no public migration impact

**Analysis:**
The provided file `/home/founder/Downloads/zig-x86_64-linux-0.16.0-dev.1303+ee0a0f119/lib/std/json/scanner_test.zig` is completely empty (contains no code). This appears to be a test file for JSON scanner functionality that hasn't been implemented yet or was intentionally cleared. Since there are no public APIs, types, or functions exported from this file, it has no migration impact for developers.
