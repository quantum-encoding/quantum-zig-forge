# Migration Card: std.compress.xz

## 1) Concept

This file serves as the main entry point for the XZ compression/decompression module in Zig's standard library. It primarily re-exports the `Decompress` module from `xz/Decompress.zig`, providing access to XZ decompression functionality. The file also includes test declarations to ensure the module's functionality is properly validated.

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

**SKIP: Cannot analyze API changes from re-export only file**

This file only contains module re-exports and test declarations. The actual public API is defined in `xz/Decompress.zig`, which is not provided in the analysis scope. To properly analyze migration changes, the `Decompress.zig` file would need to be examined for:
- Allocator patterns in decompression initialization
- Stream interface changes
- Error handling evolution
- Memory management API changes

## 3) The Golden Snippet

**SKIP: No direct public API in this file**

## 4) Dependencies

Based on the import structure:
- Primary dependency: Internal `xz/Decompress.zig` module
- Test dependency: `xz/test.zig` for validation

**Note**: This is a facade module - actual implementation and public API reside in the imported submodules.
