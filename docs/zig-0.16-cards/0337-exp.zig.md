# Migration Card: Complex Exponential Function

## 1) Concept

This file implements the complex exponential function `e^z` for complex numbers in Zig's standard library. It's a mathematical utility function that calculates the exponential of complex numbers, handling both 32-bit and 64-bit floating point types. The implementation is ported from musl libc and includes special case handling for overflow conditions, infinities, and NaN values.

Key components include:
- A generic `exp` function that dispatches to type-specific implementations
- Separate `exp32` and `exp64` implementations optimized for different floating-point precisions
- Special handling for edge cases like pure real/imaginary inputs and overflow conditions
- Integration with a helper function `ldexp_cexp` for scaling operations in overflow ranges

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

**No significant API migration changes detected.** This is a pure mathematical function with stable signatures:

- **Function Signature Stability**: The `exp(z: anytype)` function signature remains unchanged - it takes a complex number and returns a complex number of the same type
- **No Allocator Requirements**: This is a computational function that operates entirely on stack-allocated values without heap allocation
- **No I/O Interface Changes**: The function performs mathematical computations without any I/O operations
- **Error Handling**: Uses standard floating-point error handling through NaN and infinity propagation rather than Zig error types
- **Complex Number Construction**: Uses `Complex(T).init(re, im)` pattern which has been stable across Zig versions

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const math = std.math;
const Complex = math.complex.Complex;

// Calculate e^(5 + 3i)
const a = Complex(f32).init(5, 3);
const result = math.complex.exp(a);

// result.re ≈ -146.927917, result.im ≈ 20.944065
```

## 4) Dependencies

- `std.math` - Core mathematical functions and constants
- `std.math.complex` - Complex number type definitions and operations  
- `std.testing` - Testing utilities (test-only dependency)
- Local `ldexp.zig` module - Helper functions for exponent scaling

**Note**: This file has minimal external dependencies and focuses purely on mathematical computation, making it highly stable across Zig versions.
