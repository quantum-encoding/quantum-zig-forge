# Migration Analysis: `std/dwarf/FORM.zig`

## 1) Concept

This file defines DWARF debugging information format constants used for parsing and generating DWARF debug data. It contains a comprehensive set of public constants representing various DWARF FORM values, which are numeric codes that specify how debugging information is encoded in DWARF sections. The constants cover standard DWARF formats like `addr`, `data1-8`, `string`, `block` types, as well as GNU extensions for features like Fission (split debug info) and DWZ multifile support.

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

**No API Changes Detected**

This file contains only constant definitions with no function signatures, struct definitions, or public APIs that would be affected by Zig 0.16 migration patterns. The constants are simple numeric values that remain unchanged across Zig versions. There are:

- No allocator requirements
- No I/O interface changes  
- No error handling modifications
- No API structure changes

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const dwarf = std.dwarf;

// Using DWARF FORM constants for debug information parsing
fn parseAttribute(form: u16) void {
    switch (form) {
        dwarf.FORM.addr => {
            // Handle address format
        },
        dwarf.FORM.string => {
            // Handle string format  
        },
        dwarf.FORM.data4 => {
            // Handle 4-byte data format
        },
        dwarf.FORM.GNU_addr_index => {
            // Handle GNU Fission extension
        },
        else => {
            // Handle other formats
        },
    }
}
```

## 4) Dependencies

**No External Dependencies**

This is a leaf module that doesn't import any other standard library modules. It only exports constant values for DWARF format codes.

**Migration Impact: None** - This file contains only constant definitions that remain compatible across Zig versions.
