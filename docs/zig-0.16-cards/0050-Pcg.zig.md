# Migration Card: `std/Random/Pcg.zig`

## 1) Concept
This file implements the PCG32 pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) algorithm. It provides a PCG random number generator struct with methods for initialization, seeding, and generating random values. The key components include the PCG state (64-bit state and increment values), core generation algorithm via the `next()` function, and buffer filling capability through the `fill()` method.

The implementation follows the PCG random number generation specification and provides integration with Zig's standard Random interface through the `random()` method, allowing it to be used as a drop-in PRNG with Zig's random number utilities.

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

**No significant API signature changes detected.** This PCG implementation follows consistent patterns across versions:

- **Initialization Pattern**: Uses simple struct initialization with `init()` function that takes a seed value
- **No Allocator Dependency**: This PRNG implementation is entirely allocation-free
- **Consistent Interface**: The `random()` method returns a `std.Random` interface wrapper, maintaining compatibility
- **Direct State Access**: Fields `s` and `i` remain accessible for direct state manipulation

The API structure remains stable with the simple `init(seed)` pattern rather than requiring more complex factory patterns seen in other migrated components.

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const Pcg = std.Random.Pcg;

// Initialize with seed
var pcg = Pcg.init(42);

// Get std.Random interface
var rng = pcg.random();

// Generate random values using the standard interface
const random_u32 = rng.int(u32);
const random_bool = rng.boolean();

// Or use the PCG directly to fill buffers
var buffer: [16]u8 = undefined;
pcg.fill(&buffer);
```

## 4) Dependencies
- `std` (base import)
- `std.Random` (interface integration)
- `std.Random.SplitMix64` (internal seeding)
- `std.testing` (test framework only)

**Note**: This implementation has minimal dependencies and is self-contained for its core functionality, using SplitMix64 only for initial seeding when a single 64-bit seed is provided.
