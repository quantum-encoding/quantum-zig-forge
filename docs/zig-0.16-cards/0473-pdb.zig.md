# Migration Card: `std/pdb.zig`

## 1) Concept

This file provides type definitions and constants for working with the Program Data Base (PDB) debugging information format used primarily for Windows executables. It contains unopinionated data structures representing the various components of PDB files, including stream headers, symbol records, type information, line number data, and file structure definitions. The module serves as a foundation for PDB parsing implementations (like `std.debug.Pdb`) by defining the binary layout of PDB structures without implementing parsing logic itself.

Key components include:
- Stream headers (DbiStreamHeader, SuperBlock)
- Symbol and type record definitions (SymbolKind, ProcSym, RecordPrefix)
- Debug subsection structures (DebugSubsectionHeader, LineFragmentHeader)
- Various PDB-specific data structures like SectionContribEntry, ModInfo, and checksum entries

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

**No public function signature changes detected.** This file contains only type definitions, constants, and enum declarations - no public functions that would require migration.

Key observations:
- Contains only `extern struct`, `enum`, and `const` definitions
- No allocator-dependent functions or factory patterns
- No I/O interfaces or file operations
- No error handling constructs
- Pure data definitions without behavioral implementations

The migration impact is minimal as this file defines data layouts rather than providing operational APIs. Developers using these types would only need to ensure their usage patterns align with Zig 0.16's type system, but the actual definitions appear unchanged.

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const pdb = std.pdb;

// Example: Checking PDB file magic signature
fn validatePdbMagic(super_block: pdb.SuperBlock) bool {
    return std.mem.eql(u8, &super_block.file_magic, pdb.SuperBlock.expect_magic);
}

// Example: Working with symbol records
fn getSymbolKind(prefix: pdb.RecordPrefix) pdb.SymbolKind {
    return prefix.record_kind;
}
```

## 4) Dependencies

- `std.mem` - For memory operations and comparisons
- `std.math` - For mathematical utilities
- `std.coff` - For COFF format definitions (related executable format)
- `std.fs` - For file system operations (File type)
- `std.debug` - For debugging utilities
- `std.ArrayList` - For dynamic array operations

**Note**: This is a data definition module with no runtime behavior, so dependencies are primarily for type references and utility functions used by consumers of these types.
