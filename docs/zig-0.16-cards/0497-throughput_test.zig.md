SKIP: Internal implementation file - no public migration impact

**Analysis Rationale:**
- The file path indicates this is a throughput test (`throughput_test.zig`)
- Empty file content suggests this is either a placeholder or intentionally blank
- No public API exports are present in the provided file content
- Throughput tests are typically internal benchmarking tools, not public-facing APIs
- No migration impact for Zig developers using the standard library's public interfaces

This file does not require migration analysis as it contains no public APIs that would affect user code when upgrading from Zig 0.11 to 0.16.
