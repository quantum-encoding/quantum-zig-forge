# Migration Card: std/math/big.zig

## 1) Concept
This file is the main entry point for Zig's arbitrary-precision arithmetic (big integer) functionality. It serves as a module re-export hub that defines the fundamental limb types used in big integer representations and provides access to the main big integer implementation through `big/int.zig`.

The key components include type definitions for the building blocks of big integer arithmetic: `Limb` (the base unsigned integer type), `SignedLimb`, `DoubleLimb` (for carrying intermediate results), `HalfLimb`, and their signed counterparts. These types are computed based on the host architecture's `usize` characteristics.

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff
**No public function signature changes detected in this file.** This is primarily a type definition and module re-export file. The actual big integer API implementations reside in `big/int.zig`, which is re-exported via `pub const int`.

The migration patterns to observe would be in the imported `big/int.zig` module, which this file doesn't directly expose. This file maintains stable type definitions that are architecture-dependent but don't exhibit the typical 0.16 migration patterns like explicit allocators or I/O interface changes.

## 3) The Golden Snippet
```zig
const std = @import("std");
const big = std.math.big;

// Access the big integer types and implementation
const BigInt = big.int.Managed;
const Limb = big.Limb;
const DoubleLimb = big.DoubleLimb;

// Example usage of the limb types (actual usage from this file)
const limb_size: usize = @bitSizeOf(Limb);
const can_use_double_limb = @bitSizeOf(DoubleLimb) == 2 * @bitSizeOf(Limb);
```

## 4) Dependencies
- `std` (root import)
- `std.debug.assert` (for compile-time validation)
- `std.meta.Int` (for type construction)
- `std.math.Log2Int` (for limb logarithm type)

**Note**: This file serves as a facade for the actual big integer implementation in `big/int.zig`. The migration impact analysis should continue with the `big/int.zig` file to understand the complete public API changes for big integer functionality.
