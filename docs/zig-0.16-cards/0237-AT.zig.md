# Migration Card: `std/dwarf/AT.zig`

## 1) Concept

This file is a DWARF debugging information attribute constants definition file. It contains a comprehensive collection of public constants representing DWARF attribute codes used in debugging information entries (DIEs). The file organizes attributes by DWARF specification versions (DWARF 2 through 5) and includes vendor-specific extensions from MIPS, HP, GNU, VMS, GNAT, Zig, UPC, and PGI.

The key components are integer literal constants that serve as identifiers for different debugging attributes like `name`, `byte_size`, `location`, `type`, and many others. These constants are used throughout the DWARF debugging infrastructure to identify and process different types of debugging information in compiled binaries.

## 2) The 0.11 vs 0.16 Diff

**No migration changes detected.** This file contains only public constant declarations with integer literal values. There are:

- No function signatures to migrate
- No allocator requirements
- No I/O interface changes  
- No error handling changes
- No API structure changes

The constants are simple integer values that remain compatible across Zig versions. The usage pattern involves importing the module and referencing the constants directly, which works identically in both Zig 0.11 and 0.16.

## 3) The Golden Snippet

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const AT = std.dwarf.AT;

// Using DWARF attribute constants for debugging information
const name_attr = AT.name;           // 0x03
const byte_size_attr = AT.byte_size; // 0x0b
const type_attr = AT.type;           // 0x49

// Accessing vendor-specific extensions
const zig_parent_attr = AT.ZIG_parent; // 0x2ccd
const gnu_vector_attr = AT.GNU_vector; // 0x2107
```

## 4) Dependencies

This file has **zero dependencies** - it does not import any Zig standard library modules. It is a self-contained collection of integer constants that can be used independently throughout the DWARF debugging system.
