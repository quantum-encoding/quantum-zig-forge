SKIP: Internal implementation file - no public migration impact

**Analysis:**

This file (`zon.zig`) serves as a public API facade that re-exports functionality from submodules. While it provides public exports (`parse`, `stringify`, `Serializer`), these are simply module references to implementation files (`zon/parse.zig`, `zon/stringify.zig`, `zon/Serializer.zig`). The actual public API signatures and migration changes would be found in those submodules, not in this facade file itself.

The file contains:
- Module documentation about ZON format
- Public re-exports of submodules  
- Basic test declarations

Since this file doesn't contain any actual function implementations or type definitions, there are no public API signatures to analyze for migration patterns between Zig 0.11 and 0.16.
