Cognitive Oracle Trinity - Testing Status
==========================================
Date: 2025-10-27

CURRENT ISSUE:
--------------
The eBPF program (cognitive-oracle) is loaded and attached to the
tracepoint/syscalls/sys_enter_write tracepoint, but all statistics are zero.
This means it's not intercepting ANY write() syscalls.

eBPF PROGRAM STATUS:
-------------------
- Program loaded: YES (confirmed via bpftool)
- Tracepoint: tracepoint/syscalls/sys_enter_write
- Process filter: Checks for "claude" in comm
- Stats all zero: PROBLEM

DEBUGGING STEPS:
----------------
1. Created test-minimal.bpf.c - a minimal eBPF program that counts ALL writes
   with no filtering. This will verify if the tracepoint fires at all.

2. If test-minimal works (counter increases):
   - Problem is in cognitive-oracle.bpf.c logic
   - Likely the is_claude_process() check is failing

3. If test-minimal doesn't work (counter stays zero):
   - Tracepoint isn't firing on this kernel
   - May need different tracepoint or approach

FILES CREATED:
--------------
- cognitive-oracle.bpf.c - Main eBPF program (14K)
- cognitive-watcher.zig - Userspace consumer (7.5M binary)
- test-minimal.bpf.c - Minimal test (6.5K)
- test-claude-capture.c - ptrace test program

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Test minimal eBPF to verify tracepoint works
2. If tracepoint works, debug why is_claude_process() isn't matching
3. Consider alternative: use raw_tracepoint or kprobe instead
4. Once writes detected, verify cognitive state parsing

ARCHITECTURE:
-------------
Kernel (eBPF) → Ring Buffer → cognitive-watcher → D-Bus → chronosd-cognitive
                                                         ↓
                                                  chronos-stamp-cognitive
