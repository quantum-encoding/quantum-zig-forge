Final test of the complete cognitive state capture system.

When this file is written, the tool-result-hook will fire.
At that moment, chronos-stamp will query get-cognitive-state.
The script will read from /var/lib/cognitive-watcher/cognitive-states.db.
The database contains the parsed cognitive state captured by the watcher.

Expected result: Git commit message contains my actual status line.
