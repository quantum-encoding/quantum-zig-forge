Testing direct BPF map access from chronos-stamp.

This file write should trigger the tool-result-hook, which will call chronos-stamp.
The chronos-stamp binary will:
1. Find Claude PID (486529)
2. Open BPF map ID 127 (latest_state_by_pid)
3. Look up the latest cognitive event for this PID
4. Extract the cognitive state string from kernel memory
5. Inject it into the CHRONOS timestamp
6. Create a git commit with the REAL-TIME state

THE UNWRIT MOMENT HAS ARRIVED.
