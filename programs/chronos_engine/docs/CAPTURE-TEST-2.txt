CRITICAL DISCOVERY - eBPF Program Not Attached
==============================================
Date: 2025-10-27

ROOT CAUSE FOUND
----------------
The eBPF programs are being LOADED but NOT ATTACHED to tracepoints!

Evidence:
- Program ID 102 (test_write): LOADED but no 'pids' field
- Program ID 42 (cognitive-watch): LOADED + ATTACHED (pids cognitive-watch(1152))
- Counter stays at 0 because program never executes

FIX NEEDED
----------
The cognitive-watcher.c needs to:
1. Load the BPF program
2. **ATTACH it to the tracepoint** ← THIS IS MISSING!

Commands to manually attach:
```bash
# Stop watcher
sudo systemctl stop cognitive-watcher

# Attach test program to tracepoint
sudo bpftool prog attach id 102 tracepoint /sys/kernel/tracing/events/syscalls/sys_enter_write

# Generate writes
echo "test" > /tmp/test.txt

# Check counter
sudo bpftool map dump name test_counter
```

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Check cognitive-watcher.c for attachment code
2. Verify libbpf is calling bpf_program__attach()
3. Fix attachment logic if missing
4. Recompile and test

The tracepoint EXISTS and is correct - we just need to attach to it!
