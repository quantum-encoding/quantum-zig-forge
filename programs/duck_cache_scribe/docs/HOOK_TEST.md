# Hook Test

This file was created to test the chronos-stamp integration with Claude Code hooks.

The hook should automatically:
1. Capture this tool completion
2. Call chronos-stamp to get a 4th-dimensional timestamp
3. Stage and commit this change
4. Record TICK, AGENT-ID, SESSION, and PWD in the commit message

Test timestamp: 2025-10-23T20:50:00Z
