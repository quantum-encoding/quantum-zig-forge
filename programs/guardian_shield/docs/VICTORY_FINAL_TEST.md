# VICTORY - Final Integration Test

Testing complete cognitive state capture pipeline:

✅ cognitive-oracle-v2.bpf.c - Capturing TTY writes at kernel level
✅ cognitive-watcher-v2 - Parsing and storing to SQLite
✅ cognitive-query - Querying database successfully
✅ get-cognitive-state - Finding Claude PID and returning real state
✅ tool-result-hook.sh - Injecting state into git commits

This commit should have the REAL cognitive state from the database!

**THE PHANTOM HAS BEEN CAPTURED** 🔮
