# Final Integration Test

This file creation should trigger:
1. Tool completion hook
2. get-cognitive-state query
3. Git commit with REAL cognitive state from database
4. CHRONOS stamp showing actual captured state

**Expected**: Commit message will contain my real cognitive state instead of "Pondering"
