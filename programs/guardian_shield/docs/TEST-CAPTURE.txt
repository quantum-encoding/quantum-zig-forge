Testing Claude Code Output Capture
===================================

This file is being created to trigger Claude Code's stdout/stderr writes.

The test-claude-capture program should intercept:
- Tool completion messages
- Status updates
- Any other output Claude writes to the terminal

Timestamp: Mon Oct 27 18:35:00 CET 2025

Let's see what Claude actually outputs!

EDIT TEST: This line was added by an Edit tool call.
This should trigger more stdout writes.
